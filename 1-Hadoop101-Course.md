Learn the basics of Apache Hadoop, a free, open source, Java-based programming framework. Why was it invented?

    Learn about Hadoop's architecture and core components, such as MapReduce and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
    Learn how to add and remove nodes from Hadoop clusters, how to check available disk space on each node, and how to modify configuration parameters.
    Learn about other Apache projects that are part of the Hadoop ecosystem, including Pig, Hive, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Sqoop, Flume, among others.  BDU provides separate courses on these other projects, but we recommend you start here.
